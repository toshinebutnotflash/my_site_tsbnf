  Cargo pants or cargo trousers, also sometimes called combat pants or combat trousers
  after their original purpose as military workwear,[1] are loosely cut pants originally
  designed for rough work environments and outdoor activities, distinguished by numerous
  large utility pockets for carrying tools. Cargo shorts are a shorts version of the cargo pants,
  with the legs usually extending down to near-knee lengths.
  Both cargo pants and shorts have since become also popular as an urban casual wear,
  since they are loose-fitting and quite convenient for carrying extra items during everyday
  foot trips or while cycling.

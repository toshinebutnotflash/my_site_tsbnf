  <strong>It's a knit made of good material.</strong>
  I used trendy green fabric, and I used high-made fabric.<br>
  Based on the YYK zipper and good finish, we provide the best experience.
  There are two basic varieties of knit fabric: weft-knit and warp-knit fabric.[1]
  Warp-knitted fabrics such as tricot and milanese are resistant to runs, and are commonly used in lingerie.
  Weft-knit fabrics are easier to make and more common. When cut, they will unravel (run) unless repaired.
  Warp-knit fabrics are resistant to runs and relatively easy to sew.
  Raschel lace—the most common type of machine made lace—is a warp knit fabric but using many more guide-bars (12+)
  than the usual machines which mostly have three or four bars.
